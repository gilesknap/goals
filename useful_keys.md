# Useful keys I forget

- Alt shift left/right arrow - increase/decrease selection - remapped to Hyper M and ,
- shift F10 - right click (also application key - Layer 2 c)

## same as browser

- Ctrl shift pageup/pagedown - move tabs left/right in editor group
- Alt left/right arrow - go back/forward in editor history

## Todo

Obsolete for old keyboard: 4remove keypad bindings from keyboard because it makes Alt+Shift+Left/Right not work
