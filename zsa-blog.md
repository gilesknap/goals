Work Faster in VSCode with a ZSA Voyager Keyboard
=================================================

Introduction
------------

Every few years I have a go at learning to use my IDE without a mouse. I've
put hours of effort in and always failed. That is until I purchased a
[ZSA Voyager keyboard](https://www.zsa.io/voyager/) a couple of weeks ago.

In this post I'll explain how I have achieved this and provide details on how
you can do the same. Although I'm using the Voyager, these tips will work for
many keyboards, but you will get the best results with a keyboard that is:

- programmable, preferably with [QMK](https://qmk.fm/) or [ZMK](https://zmk.dev/)
- [ortholinear](https://www.howtogeek.com/70291/what-is-an-ortholinear-keyboard-and-should-you-use-one/)

Motivation
----------

The primary goal here is to avoid RSI issues. But in doing so you will also
become more productive. To be most comfortable using a PC, and to keep your
workflow as smooth as possible it is best to:

1. keep your fingers as close to the home row as much as possible
1. always be able to find the home row without looking
1. avoid using the mouse
1. keep your gaze on the screen as much as possible

Maybe the worlds greatest touch typists can do all of the above with the
default vscode keybindings on a standard full sized keyboard. But I've not seen
anyone achieve that in practice.

For me the worst RSI is neck pain and headaches from hundreds of glances down
at the keyboard every day (for 45 years).

Why the Voyager?
