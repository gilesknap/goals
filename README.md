# Some goals to keep up coding skills


## RSI avoidance
Learn keyboard only in vscode
- https://dev.to/waylonwalker/keyboard-driven-vscode-n0a
- https://dev.to/vaidotas/get-faster-vscode-navigation-without-a-mouse-3d0m
- to this end I replaced the x-bows with a ZSA Voyager
    - https://www.zsa.io/voyager/
    - made some vscode keybindings for the Hyper thumb key as per this file
      - [keybindings.json](keybindings.json)
    - and this config
      - https://configure.zsa.io/voyager/layouts/pDAzE/latest/0
    - plus picked [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/) as a typing tutor
- idea 2: use a trackball with no switches instead of mouse, the navigation layer I
  made for the keyboard already has left hand mouse buttons plus everything else
  I imagine I need - will see how effective this is when the trackball arrives:
  - https://ploopy.co/nano-trackball/
  - terrible name but only product like it I could find
