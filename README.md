# Some goals to keep up coding skills


## RSI avoidance
Learn zero glances at the keyboard.
Learn keyboard only in vscode.
- to this end I replaced the x-bows with a ZSA Voyager
    - https://www.zsa.io/voyager/
    - made some vscode keybindings for the Hyper thumb key as per this file
      - [hyperkey](hyperkey.md)
    - and this config
      - https://configure.zsa.io/voyager/layouts/pDAzE/latest/0
    - plus picked [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/) as a typing tutor
- idea 2: use a trackball with no switches instead of mouse, the navigation layer I
  made for the keyboard already has left hand mouse buttons plus everything else
  I imagine I need - will see how effective this is when the trackball arrives:

  - terrible name but only product like it I could find
