# Using the Keyboard More with VSCode

Ideas for avoiding the use of mouse in order to improve workflow speed and
reduce RSI risk. This repo is specifically aimed at the ZSA voyager keyboard
but other keyboard users can take advantage of most of these ideas.


- Get a decent
  [ortholinear keyboard](https://www.daskeyboard.com/blog/what-is-an-ortholinear-keyboard/)

  - e.g. the excellent ZSA Voyager. For a layout starter on a Voyager
    [see my config](https://configure.zsa.io/voyager/layouts/pDAzE/latest)

- Use some Hyper Key navigation and window management bindings in vscode
  - see [hyperkey.md](hyperkey.md)

- Memorize additional useful keyboard shortcuts for editing and navigating

  - see [goodkeys.md](goodkeys.md)

- Use a trackball with no switches instead of mouse

  - https://ploopy.co/nano-trackball/
  - the only product like it I could find that looked appropriate. All others,
    are designed like mice and would need to move the hand too much to operate.
  - this implies configuring mouse buttons and wheel in a layer in a custom
    keyboard. It is also most appropriate for a split keyboard so the trackball
    can sit near one thumb.

- Using the above, learn zero glances at the keyboard. (neck RSI!)
